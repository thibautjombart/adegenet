   `tab()` internally to avoid https://github.com/thibautjombart/adegenet/issues/331

DEPENDENCIES

 - Suggested packages tripack and akima have been removed and replaced with
   interp, which is used in the tutorials.
   (see https://github.com/thibautjombart/adegenet/issues/332)

NEW MANAGEMENT

  - Zhian N. Kamvar is now the acting maintainer of the package.

NEW FEATURES

  - While creating genind from dataframe, it is now possible to skip
    the test of the ploidy that was added in 2.1.1 by passing the option
    check.ploidy = FALSE to the function df2genind. Thanks to Frederic Michaud
    for the fix. See https://github.com/thibautjombart/adegenet/issues/231 and
    https://github.com/thibautjombart/adegenet/pull/232 for details

  - `showmekittens()` has gained several new kittens thanks to @rdecamp

    export to MVmapper functionality.
    
BUG FIXES

  - A bug where the number of alleles per locus was unaffected after subsetting
    a population with `drop = FALSE` has been fixed. Now, by default, the 
    `@loc.n.all` slot (accessor: `nAll()`) will store the number of observed
    alleles in the current data set, regardless of whether or not these were
    dropped from the data matrix. 
    See https://github.com/thibautjombart/adegenet/issues/234 for details.
    
  - `seppop()` will now take into account `NA` population assignments with the
    new `keepNA` argument. 
    See https://github.com/thibautjombart/adegenet/pull/236 for details.

  - `snapclust()` likelihood calculation was incorrect for haploids. This has
    been fixed in commits 3a5f820db388c9821c3095cd29ad3cd3843237a5 and
    e41d2d598369bb5921465a60adffac9ecb61f86d. 

MISC

  - `snapclust()` will give a better warning message when the number of
    samples in the dataset exceeds computer precision. See
    https://github.com/thibautjombart/adegenet/issues/221 for details.
    
  - `df2genind()` now imports data >100x faster 
    (@KlausVigo, https://github.com/thibautjombart/adegenet/pulls/260)

			CHANGES IN ADEGENET VERSION 2.1.1
BUG FIXES

  - A warning will be issued if the user specifies a ploidy range that is less
    than the observed allele dosage when data is imported by df2genind. See

	o df2genind will now replace "." in alleles with "_" (or "p" if sep = "_")
	see https://github.com/thibautjombart/adegenet/issues/132 for details

	o if several locus names would partially match through grep,

	bug. This is a temporary replacement, waiting for ape to implement
	the changes (currently, adegenet replaces ape's as.list.DNAbin
	function with a corrected version).



			CHANGES IN ADEGENET VERSION 1.2-6


NEW FEATURES

	o pairwise.fst: computes Nei's pairwise Fst between populations

	o alignment2genind: extract polymorphism from nucleic and proteic
	aligned sequences with the 'alignment' format, returning a genind object.

	procedure was not found for genind/genpop objects. Fixed now.



			CHANGES IN ADEGENET VERSION 1.2-3


NEW FEATURES

	o implement handling of presence/absence markers. genind and
	genpop object now have a 'type' attribute to differentiate between
	codominant markers (e.g. microsatellite), which is the default
	type, and presence/absence data (e.g. AFLP). Functions in adegenet
	now behave according to the type of markers being used.

	o SNP can now be obtained from sequence data, stored as DNAbin
	(see E. Paradis's package 'ape'). They can be selected to verify
	any given degree of polymorphism.

	o 'hybridize' can now be used for genotypes having any even degree
	of ploidy (e.g. tetraploid genotypes).

	o the new function 'isPoly' checks which loci are polymorphic, or
	which alleles contribute to polymorphism.

	o the new function 'pop' can be used to retrieve and set the pop
	slot of genind object.

	o the new function 'selPopSize' allows one to select a subset of
	genotypes belonging to well-sampled populations, as defined by a
	threshold sample size.

	o the new accessor 'locNames' can be used to retrieve real labels
	of markers and/or alleles.

	o the loadingplot has been modified to allow specifying x axis, so
	that scoring SNPs along their sequence is now possible.


BUG FIXES

	o no bug to fix this version!



			CHANGES IN ADEGENET VERSION 1.2-2


NEW FEATURES

	o implement different levels of ploidy in genind / genpop objects
	(new slot @ploidy). Now, any level of ploidy can be handled by
	input function df2genind, which has been recoded almost
	entierely. Different levels of ploidy are now handled by different
	functions.

	o a "sep" argument is now handled by df2genind: this allows
	reading many data formats.

	o implemented a method "scaleGen" for genind / genpop objects,
	which scales allelic data using different methods.

	o  colorplot: a generic function, with a method for spca
	objects. Represents up to three principal components based on RGB
	representation of Cavalli-Sforza.

	o loadingplot for plotting loadings of one axis

	o adegenetTutorial function which opens the online tutorials

	o allow for the use of na.replace and scaleGen in spca function

BUG FIXES

	o fixed bug 1.2-2.01 (read.structure issue): was due to the
	default of "onerowperind" argument.

	o fixed bug 1.2-2.02 (read.genetix issue): was due to an
	error in the data file (wrong nloc); now read.genetix corrects
	that automatically and issues a warning.

	o fixed bug 1.2-2.03 (monmonier issue): was a non-detected
	code 2 due to intersection check with previously drawn segment
	(was not always removed).

	o fixed bug 1.2-2.05 (a few fixes/improvement for monmonier)



			CHANGES IN ADEGENET VERSION 1.2-1


NEW FEATURES

	o documentation of scaleGen provides an example of usefulness of
	an appropriate scaling in PCA

	different types of scaling.

	o added several coercion methods, from genind/genpop to
	data.frame, matrix and ktab objects.

	o implemented propTyped, a function giving the proportion of
	non-missing data in different ways.

BUG FIXES

	o missing data indicated in summary corrected (loci with more
	alleles had more weight in the computations).




			CHANGES IN ADEGENET VERSION 1.1-3


NEW FEATURES

	o 'as' methods for genind/genpop objects to matrix, data.frame,
	and ktab objects. Now, ordination implemented as dudi functions in
	ade4 (like dudi.pca) can be performed directly using genind/genpop
	as inputs.




			CHANGES IN ADEGENET VERSION 1.1-2


NEW FEATURES

	o significant improvement in the speed of genind2df (more than
	twice as fast as before).

	o function propShared added: computes the proportion of shared
	alleles among a set of genotypes (core computations in C).

	o A warning is issued when NAs exist in the input of sPCA.

	o improvement of the validity checking for genind/genpop:
	validObject now detects duplicates in any kind of names (ind.names,
	pop.names, etc.) and prints the corresponding items.

BUG FIXES

	o genind2df does now handles the pop argument correctly.

	o df2genind does no longer bug when there is an entirely non-typed
	locus.



			CHANGES IN ADEGENET VERSION 1.1-1


NEW FEATURES

	o I/O: df2genind no longer fails when entirely non-type
	individuals exist.

	o Monmonier: optimize.monmonier now computes the 'best'
	boundary only once instead of twice. The whole code was re-thought
	and optimized for speed. Monmonier's boundaries can now form
	loops. Instead of stoping at a given threshold, it is also
	possible to ask for a given length of boundary (argument
	bd.length).

	o The function chooseCN has a new option to return a list of
	spatial weights defined as the inverse of spatial distances, at a
	given exponent.

	o A wrapper for glob.varcomp has been implemented for genind
	objects, through the new function fstat.

	o The elements of the @other slot are now proceeded wisely when
	objects are subsetted using the '[' operator.


BUG FIXES

	o I/O: df2genind no longer fails when entirely non-type
	individuals exist.

	o monmonier no longer fails when coordinates are drawn from a
	regular grid. The matched call of the returned object has been
	fixed.

	available for formats of GENETIX, Fstat, Genepop, STRUCTURE and
	from data.frames of genotypes. Export from genind to data.frame of
	genotypes.

	o Data: five new simulated geo-referenced datasets

	o Simulations: a hybridize function, which creates hybrids from
	two parent datasets. Can output to STRUCTURE format.

	o Data manipulation: new function to separate data by
	population. Accessors to genind and genpop object like with
	matrices using 'foo[ chosenGenotypes, chosenAlleles]'.

NEW FEATURES

	o adegenetWeb is a simple function opening the adegenet website in
	the default web browser.

	o sim2pop is a dataset obtained by simulation using the software
	Easypop. It contains 130 georeferenced genotypes sampled from two
	distinct populations.

	o monmonier documentation was improved by adding a genetic
	example, using sim2pop data.

BUG FIXES

	o some bugs corrected in optimize.monmonier


			CHANGES IN ADEGENET VERSION 1.0-1

	o chooseCN is a simple interactive tool for choosing and building
	a connection network from spatial coordinates. This tool is called
	by monmonier function.

	o monmonier, optimize.monmonier, plot.monmonier and print.monmonier
	implement the Monmonier algorithm. While not restrained to genetic
	data analysis, this method can be used to find genetic boundaries
	among individuals or populations based on their allelic
	frequencies and spatial coordinates.

BUG FIXES

	o several bugs fixed in I/O functions
